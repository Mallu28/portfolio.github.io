    <h3><span>Title: </span>Development of VTOL (Vertical Take-off & Landing) system for an RC Plane</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>In this project, we have analyzed similar systems and chose the correct measurements like 
take-off weight and aspect ratio and completed further calculations. We designed the model using SolidWorks software. Then, we have conducted the analysis 
using XFLR and ANSYS software, and the results obtained were up to the mark. We have used Depron material for fabrication of RC Plane and Aluminum alloy bars for vertical 
take-off and landing mechanism. The electronics used were up to the requirements of our project. In that, the main 
components were – Pixhawk flight controller, BLDC motors, ESC’s and many other 
equipment’s. Then, we have completed the fabrication, and also conducted some flight testing. The plane 
can able to take-off and land vertically, and the forward flight was also stable.</h3>
